## About the Challenge
Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection helps in reducing the number of deaths. Automated 3D Breast Ultrasound is a newer approach for breast screening, which has many advantages over handheld mammography such as safety, speed, and higher detection rate of breast cancer. Thus it could prevail over the world in next several years. 

Tumor segmentation, classification and detection are three basic tasks in medical image analysis. These tasks are very challenging on 3D ABUS volumes for large tumor size and shape variation, irregular and ambiguous tumor boundaries, and low signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, there are rare open accessible ABUS datasets with well labeled tumor, which hinder the development of breast tumor segmentation, classification and detection systems.

Thus, we try to host the first Tumor Segmentation, Classification and Detection Challenge on Automated 3D Breast Ultrasound 2023 (Named TSCD-ABUS2023) to start a new research topic and make a solid benchmark for 3D ABUS image segmentation, classification and detection tasks. 

We have collected 200 3D volumes with refined both tumor boundaries and categories labeling from an experienced clinician, 100 for the training dataset, 70 for the closed testing dataset and 30 for the opened validated dataset. Dice, HD, are adopted as evaluation metrics for segmentation, accuracy and AUC are used as evaluation metrics for classification and  mAP@0.75 is taken for detection. This challenge will also promote the breast cancer treatment, interactions between researchers and interdisciplinary communication.
